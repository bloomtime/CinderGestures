Andrew, Hai, Chris: this is a library Ryan and I were working on for a while. The pinch stuff is most 
well thought out, and includes a mechanism for listeners to say whether they claim a point or not.

The pinch stuff includes support for projecting pinches onto a sphere for manipulating a 3D camera,
which is probably of interest as it might save you some time if you try to do something similar. The 
2D pinch stuff here is more straight forward and is a variation of the map-specific stuff in the
https://github.com/randomEtc/modestmaps-cinder project.

The double-tap stuff can/should probably be adapted to use the new Cinder Timeline support. The issue
is that you probably want to suppress the reporting of single-tap events until a double-tap has fired
(with e.g. a ~200ms delay). This means re-working apps that already support single-tap before you can
use double-tap.

Other event support is really just sketched out, we had plans for:

* double tap / single tap
* two-finger tap
* two-finger double tap
* tap and hold
* pinch/spread (zoom out, zoom in) (2+ fingers?)
* 3 finger pinch (gather?)
* two-finger rotation
* three+ finger twist
* one/two/three/four finger swipe
* palm print :)
* full multi-touch transform (a la modestmaps, with optional rotation)

...

To add this lib to an existing git-managed Cinder project do:

git submodule add git@github.com:bloomtime/CinderGestures.git blocks/CinderGestures

And then add the relevant folders (include) to your project. Don't add the samples folder (I just add 
everything and then remove the irrelevant bits).
